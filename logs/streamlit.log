[2025-05-23 10:52:12.339] [ctranslate2] [thread 55] [warning] The compute type inferred from the saved model is float16, but the target device or backend do not support efficient float16 computation. The model weights have been automatically converted to use the float32 compute type instead.
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.
